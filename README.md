# Simple_Linear_Regression

Naman is working as a Research Analyst for a Company and wants to write a research based article on what should a startup focus on intial years in order to grow.

Naman went to 50 startups and met their founder and asked for data anonymously.

How much company spent in Research and Development(RND),Marketing(MKT),Administration(ADMIN),State(STATE) and what was the Profit.

So the data collected is 50Startup's.csv file.(https://www.kaggle.com/code/kavita5/linear-regression-50-startup/data)

Here I am Predicting Profit using only one predictor(SLR) and based on EDA I have selected RND(As higher the amount,the Profit is High).
